This R-markdown is divided into three parts : 
1. Predicts the posterior mean heights for a given set of weights
2. Gives the estimated 90% credible interval for the posterior mean as well as the predicted height.
3. Gives the estimated 90% credible interval for posterior mean and predicted heights but using logarithmic relationship between weight and height
